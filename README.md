# Overview
This is a social platform for building community playlists. It was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgrSQL on the back end and Ember on the front end.

The general idea of the project is that a user can sign up and in to Trebl and see a list of playlists made by other users. A user can also 'comment' on this playlist, thereby adding their mark on the playlist based in the original posters song choice. In future iterations, users will be able to 'friend' each other and create social playlists just amongst select groups of friends.

# This Version

TREBL 1.0 (Beta)

The first version of this project is a slightly scaled down version of the eventual product. I have chosen the members of the GA community to be the first users. Together, we can make Trebl our very own playlist. In the landing page, a user can see all the songs that have been posted so far and search for songs to add to the playlist. A user can then update the description of the song and even delete the song if they no longer feel it fits the playlist.

# Tools used
I have utilized the Soundcloud API in order to search through a large database of songs and stream music from the page. In future iterations I will be implementing a song widget on the top of the screen where a user can do all the normal functions one would expect from a song player.
I am happy that I undertook a challenge by doing my project in Ember. I have hit many roadblocks along the way but think that Ember will create the best possible version of my app.

# Frustrations
I ran into a few problems during this first iteration that have better prepared me to not only to move forward with this project but also moving forward with both Rails and Ember. I wish that I had a better plan from the start which URLs I was going to use in my app to display data at the proper time in a UX that made sense.

Also, I wish I would have planned my ERD better. The relationship naming conventions I used have become confusing, especially when I attempt to explain the relationships to other developers.
