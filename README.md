# Overview
This is a social platform for building community playlists. It was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the back end and Ember.js on the front end. I also utilized the Soundcloud API in order to search through a large database of songs and stream music from the page.
The first version of this project is a slightly scaled down version of the eventual product. A user can currently search for a song, choose it and write a description of it. Users can also suggest songs based on other users song postings. The original song in addition to the comment songs make up the socially curated playlist. In the future, I hope to incorporate the SoundCloud playback widget on the page for a better playback experience for users. I would also like to incorporate a profile for a user and the ability to "friend" other users in order to more neatly organize the playlists that have been created.

# Frustrations
I ran into a few problems during this first iteration that have better prepared me to not only to move forward with this project but also have improved my skills in both Rails and Ember. I wish that I had a better plan from the start as to which URLs I was going to use in my app in order to better design my UX. Also, I wish I would have planned my naming conventions more thoroughly because the names I used have become confusing, especially when I attempt to explain the relationships to other developers.
